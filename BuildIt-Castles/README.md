# Build It Castle Edition!
Have you ever wished for an easier way to make the wizzard tower of your dreams? Have you ever wished you could build and decorate an evil dungon to hold your prisioners? Have you longed for simple snappable spiral stairs? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this is the mod for you!

## Installation (manual)
Simply put the CastleStructures.dll into the BepInEx/plugins folder along with the current JVL release, and launch the game!
Note: This mod does require that you use some form of build menu extender. I recommend Sears Catalogue by Comfy. Also for correct placement of windows in one specific type of curved wall you will need a mod that changes the rotation of pieces. Perfect Placement by Azumatt or Gizmo by Comfy are good options. Without one of these the windows for one of the curved walls will not line up quite right. It requires an extra half rotation, so if the default number of rotations in 180 degrees is 8, you would need to change it to 16 for correct placement.

## Featuring
New spiral stairs climbing both clockwise and counterclockwise and in both 2m and 4m radius. They are snappable, and smoothly climbable. Along with these spiral stairs are the requesite curved wall blocks, each of which is 1/8th of a circle, snapps to each other, and perfectly fits around the stairs. Walls also come in two versions, 2m and 4m radius. (For those of you who are a bit math challanged, it's ok we still love you, that's 4m or two full floor tiles across a the full circle for the first version, and 8m or four floor tiles across a full circle for the second version.)

In addition to all this wonderful curviness, you will find many new stone pieces to help you build the castle of your dreams! Roof pieces for your towers, new gates and doors, and a brand new snappable hearth and chimney so you can use your smoke generating hearths and the chimney will take your smoke safely out of your building, with 2 chimney caps to protect your fires from the rain!

## Changelog
1.0.0 Inital Release!
1.0.1 very minor fix for packaging and readme.
1.0.2 Fixed the Corbel corners, and low stairs as well as a few minor typos, and added a new Chimney Cap and bundled Localization file.
	Also added a few pieces that I had made previously but didn't make it into the code for the first release. This includes a circular floor transition, and 3 wood floor pieces.
